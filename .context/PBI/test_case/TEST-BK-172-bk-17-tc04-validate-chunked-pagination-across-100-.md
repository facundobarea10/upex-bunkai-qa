  # === PRECONDITIONS ===
  Given a JQL {broad_jql} returns more than 100 issues from the connected Jira instance

  # === ACTION ===
  When the user sends POST /api/v1/imports with the broad JQL

  # === VALIDATIONS ===
  Then the job completes with status "completed"
  And imported_count equals the total issue count from the JQL (e.g. 150)
  And created*count + updated*count = imported_count
  And errors is empty
  And during polling, imported_count increases monotonically (observable progress)
```

### Variables

| Variable | How to obtain |
| --- | --- |
| {broad_jql} | `project = BK ORDER BY key ASC` (returns ~150 issues as of 2026-06-21) |

### Preconditions

- Jira project must have >100 issues reachable by the JQL
- Target Bunkai project can accommodate N new stories

### Expected Results

- Worker pages through in ≤100-issue chunks per Jira Cloud limit
- Final imported_count matches the source JQL total exactly
